		<h4 class="pt-5 text-uppercase">Introduction</h4>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Problem</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">The Kelly Strayhorn is a Pittsburgh based theater that wanted us to help them increase donations, engagement, and cultivate their diverse community. The theater especially has new online oppurtunities because of COVID-19.</h5>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Goal</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">The goal of the research was to understand how users currently enjoy live and pre-recorded media to see how we can revitalize current theater events.</h5>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Solution</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">Our solution presented a way for users to interact with videos from KST by having discussion questions throughout the video.  It gives them a reason to comment and engage with videos and  allows for more active engagement with the art. </h5>
	</div>	
	<div class="container mt-5 w-75 text-center">
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Background</strong></h5>
		<ul class="insightList" >
			<li>Business is going down because people don’t have “extra” money to spend on theaters and theaters could potentially connect with essential businesses to increase engagement.</li>
			<li>Being online can make increasing inclusivity and diversity in theatre easier since experiences can be more personalized. </li>
			<li>The user has a lot more control over theatre experience in their home. </li>
			<li>The Instagram events were a good way to make theatre seem less “fancy” and more casual especially since people got to interact with members of the theater. We should find other ways to do that.</li>
			<li>There is a lack of online presence and like other theaters they can get to know their audience more personally through a stronger online presence.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>	
	<div class="container mt-5 w-75 text-center">
		<h4 class="pt-5 text-uppercase">Methods</h4>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Think-Aloud for Generative Research</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">We used the Pittsburgh Public Theater website to do a think-aloud study with the general theater audience members in Pittsburgh. We had them interact with the website in ways we thought connected to the KST goals. </h5>
		<img class="mt-3 img-fluid" src="../Assets/dance/pptImage.png" alt="Two people holding phones with the text the Show will go on over it. The person on the left is white and has short red hair. They are smiling in the picture. The one on the left is tan, has black hair, and is wearing glasses. Their eyes are wide and mouth is open and they are looking at the phones in their hands.">
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Insights</strong></h5>
		<!-- using these columns to put these three things next to each other -->
		<!-- put it in the margins rules so they look better on mobile -->
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-sm-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">Users wanted more of a variety of events.</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">Partnerships were underemphasized so even though users were interested in them they didn’t know how to access them.</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-sm-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">Users were unable to register for events easily which detered them from participating.</h5>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Contextual Inquiry and Affinity Diagramming</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">My personal favorite part of the process was conducting the contextual interviews. It was interesting trying to conduct these over Zoom as we had to get creative so that the particiapnts could show us their space. We had the particpants show us their spaces and how they interacted with media on an everyday basis in their spaces. Our focus of the contextual inquiry was answering the question: <strong>How might we engage the theater community in participating with new events?</strong></h5>

			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-6">
				<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Evidence</strong></h5>
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mt-2 my-4 divCentered">P2-15: "Eating while watching, feel like no time is lost"</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mt-2 my-4 divCentered">P3-18: "We'll talk about [shows] after more than before"</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mt-2 my-4 divCentered">P4-15: "When you are watching tik toks you can log off the tik tok anytime you want"</h5>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Insights</strong></h5>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">Users prefer to engage with media that they can enjoy flexibly.</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">Users have rituals around media and how they find them.</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">Users enjoy enhancing their experience with other people and things.</h5>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Speed Dating</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">Speed dating was an also interesting tool to use online. My team created 3 storyboards each surrounding the the needs that we had identified through our previous research. The storyboards were made with increasing risk and that needs that we identified were:<strong> multitasking, communicating with others, easily finding what the shows are about, and fitting shows into their schedules.</strong> </h5>
		<img class="img-fluid" src="../Assets/dance/speedSlides.png" alt="3 storyboards stacked on each other. Each has a title, a short description and images of stick figures going through the problem, soltion, and imagined future that the intervention causes. The storyboards shown are (from left to right) Have an automatic 'go back' option, AV/VR theater showing, and Trivia game.">
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Evidence</strong></h5>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">“The idea of being able to consume the same content at the same time I like that a lot.”</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">“I would love a trivia game because it would help bond and it seems fun to know how much you have been paying attention because there are points awarded.”</h5>
			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-4">
				<h5 class="mt-2 my-2 divCentered">“Usually I would discuss the movie after the show with friends. I usually would head to some website to learn about the show."</h5>
			</div>
		</div>	
		<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Insights</strong></h5>
		<h5 class="divCentered">Participants really identified with the need to connect with others and to find out more about shows. I was suprised how willing people were to have media services control their reccomendations because of services like Youtube and Netflix. While we also found that people felt that the feelings a physical space invoke were hard to replace that people still wanted to engage with others and find out more about the show.</h5>
		<h4 class="pt-5 text-uppercase">Intial Prototype</h4>
		<h5 class="divCentered">The initial prototype built off this idea as we used a trivia idea to allow people to compete with others while also finding out more about the show. However, since we were supposed to appeal to new community members the trivia questions were too hard for them since they had no background. I wrote this interview protocol so I feel like I got a lot of experience on interviewing people. </h5>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col col-lg-6">
				<img class="img-fluid" src="../Assets/dance/firstPrototype.png" alt="On the left there is an image showing a screenshot of a video with a caption showing the title trivia question and the question is 'Before the name change in 2001, what was the previous name of the Kelly Strayhorn Theter. On the right there is a mock up showing the question number and answers on a mobile phone. This layout is from the game 'Kahoot!'">
			</div>
			<div class="col col-lg-6">
				<h5 class="mt-4 text-uppercase"><strong>Evidence</strong></h5>
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mt-2 my-4 divCentered">“Knowing more of the backstory of art makes me enjoy it more”</h5>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<h5 class="mt-2 my-4 divCentered">“I like the trivia gave me a bit of hints into the facts and how it was kind of related to the game”</h5>
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h4 class="pt-5 text-uppercase">Final Prototype</h4>
		<h5 class="divCentered">After testing our intial prototype we found that people actually disliked how active it was and wanted to more passively engage with the content.  To remedy that we instead presented to discussion questions to both help people think more about the show and provide the theater with oppurtunity to open more discussion based events. Also, when we discussed our solution with Kelly Strayhorn theater they addressed how this might help with new theather community members have more artistic literacy. It is also easy to implement for the theater and could increase engagement on social media platforms because of the active call for discussion. </h5>
